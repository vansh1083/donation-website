<h1>Privacy Policy - Global Relief Fund</h1>
<p>Last Updated: November 21, 2025</p>

<p>
Global Relief Fund (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates this donation platform. 
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information to maintain the highest levels of **trust and transparency**.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
<p>
We only collect information strictly necessary for processing donations and communicating our impact:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>**Personal Identifiers:** Name, Email address, Phone Number (for confirmation).</li>
    <li>**Donation Details:** Donation amount and currency.</li>
    <li>**Purpose:** This information is primarily used to process your contribution and send you official confirmation receipts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Payment Information Security</h2>
<p>
Your financial security is our top priority. 
We **DO NOT store, process, or retain any card numbers, UPI IDs, or bank account details**. 
All payment transactions are securely handled by certified, third-party payment processors (e.g., PayPal, UPI services) which operate under their own strict security protocols.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Usage and Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>**Processing Donations:** We use your data exclusively to process your requested contributions.</li>
    <li>**Improving Services:** We analyze aggregated, anonymous data (like total donation count) to improve our campaigns.</li>
    <li>**Third Parties:** We **DO NOT sell or rent** your personal data to any third parties for marketing purposes. Data is only shared with payment processors to complete your transaction.</li>
    <li>**Legal Compliance:** We may disclose data if required by law (e.g., tax or fraud investigation).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Retention Policy (How Long We Keep Data)</h2>
<p>
We retain your donation records (Name, Email, Amount) for **tax reporting and compliance purposes**, as required by relevant financial laws (typically 7 years). Once this mandatory period expires, your personal identifiers are securely deleted or anonymized.
</p>

<h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>
We use basic, necessary cookies to ensure the website functions correctly (e.g., maintaining session data). We do not use intrusive third-party tracking cookies for targeted advertising.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. You can request deletion or correction of your personal data anytime, subject to our legal requirement to retain financial records (Section 4).
</p>

<h2>7. Contact and Grievances</h2>
