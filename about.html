<h1>About Global Relief Fund</h1>
<p>Last Updated: November 21, 2025</p>

<div class="mission-box">
    <h2>Our Mission: Immediate Impact, Lasting Change</h2>
    <p>
    Global Relief Fund was founded on the principle that aid should be fast, transparent, and directly accessible to those who need it most. Our mission is to mobilize resources quickly in times of crisis—whether that is a natural disaster, medical emergency, or community need—and ensure a long-term positive impact.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Our Focus Areas</h2>
<p>
We work across four critical pillars of global relief:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Disaster Response:</strong> Providing immediate food, shelter, and rebuilding support after natural calamities.</li>
    <li><strong>Critical Medical Aid:</strong> Funding life-saving treatments for families who cannot afford essential medical care.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Support:</strong> Offering direct financial aid to victims and families affected by sudden crises or attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Running tree plantation drives to restore local habitats and combat climate change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
<p>
As a non-profit organization, we understand that trust is our most valuable asset. We ensure every donor knows exactly where their money goes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zero Overhead:</strong> We aim to keep our administrative costs to an absolute minimum, ensuring the maximum amount reaches the field.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Reports:</strong> We regularly update our community on our spending and impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Donations:</strong> All donations are processed through secure gateways (UPI/PayPal) with no banking information ever stored on our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Join Our Cause</h2>
<p>
We believe in the power of collective giving. Every donation, big or small, directly fuels our ability to respond to global and local crises. Join us in making a fast, tangible difference in the lives of those facing hardship.
